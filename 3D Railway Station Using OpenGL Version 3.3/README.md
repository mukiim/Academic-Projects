# 3D Railway Station Using OpenGL Version 3.3

## Introduction
Welcome to the 3D Railway Station project! This project showcases a detailed 3D model of a railway station, implemented using OpenGL Version 3.3. It features advanced graphics techniques like lighting, texturing, and camera movements to create a realistic and interactive 3D environment.

## Features
- **Advanced Graphics Techniques:** Utilizes OpenGL shaders for realistic lighting and texturing effects.
- **Custom 3D Models:** Includes models such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and more, to construct the railway station environment.
- **Interactive Camera:** A basic and advanced camera system for navigating through the 3D scene.
- **Textured Surfaces:** Uses various textures (e.g., wood, stone, platform) to enhance the visual appeal of the scene.
- **Shaders:** Vertex and fragment shaders for different shading techniques like Gouraud and Phong shading.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler
- OpenGL Version 3.3 or higher
- GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)
- GLFW (Graphics Library Framework)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `Lighting.sln` with an IDE that supports C++ and OpenGL (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build and run the project.

## Usage
After running the application, use the camera controls to explore the 3D railway station. Experiment with different shaders and textures to see their effects on the scene.
